Also look at the sleep library in the JeeLib

JR says:
--------

Put a resistor (shunt resistor) in series with the Arduino, and measure the
voltage across it to work out the current - and hence infer the power of the
Arduino itself.

If you set the resistor to drop the voltage by an amount between the input
voltage and the voltage the Arduino regulator uses, it won't alter what it
is observing.

That setting is:
~2 volts - as that is between the 5v inside the Arduino, and 12v ish that comes in it
~0.5 amp - as that is the maximum power on a USB line etc.
R = V / I = 2 / 0.5 - 4 ohms
