EL wire

Adrian says:
    Take 5V out of Arduino - it will pull more than 40 milliamps
    Use transistor
    Voltage regulator that will turn 5V into 3V
    Vin on the Arduino is the input power before regulating
Then connect to one of these:

Inverter for EL

- this was a pain as it has a soft switch you have to press to turn it on 
after connecting the power. couldn't automate it
- the wire with the line on it goes into the corner, the other one next to it

Went for this inverter instead second time

mcknut then realised you could use a relay with the original EL wire
device, yay
